# MSCS_634_ProjectDeliverable_1

For this project, I used a dataset containing information on 375 employees, including Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience, and Salary, with Salary as the numeric target variable. When I initially inspected the dataset, I found it to be largely complete, with only two missing values per column, and no major inconsistencies or duplicates. To clean the data, I removed the rows with missing values since they represented less than 1% of the dataset, ensuring that my analysis would not be affected. I also standardized categorical values for consistency, particularly in columns like Gender and Education Level. I then conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and correlation analysis, which helped me uncover key insights: Salary is positively correlated with Years of Experience, employees with higher education levels tend to earn more, and numeric features such as Years of Experience have a stronger influence on Salary than Age. I also identified some outliers in Salary, which I plan to handle carefully during modeling to avoid skewed predictions. Overall, these steps allowed me to prepare a clean and well-structured dataset ready for feature engineering and regression modeling.
